### What I learned

This was my first time really diving into using Tailwind - I really enjoyed how intuitive Tailwind becomes after some time playing around with it as well as the out of the box design system in place that's fun to leverage.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - I was constantly refferring to the Tailwind Docs throughout the entire process - the quick search (CTRL + K) was crucial in quickly finding the exact utlity class I needed for a perticular scenario.
